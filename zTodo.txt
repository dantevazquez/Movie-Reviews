This file is just to remind myself where I left off

*I last finished adding a verify thing to the post movies router


Jan 2 goals:

Create a nav bar

When user is not logged in nav bar has a sign in 
when user is logged in, his or her name is displayed where sign in was
the name when clicked sends the logged in user to his or her profile

Jan 3 Goals: Implement comments and complete you lazy truck (talking to myself)

Jan 4 TODO: Fill the profile page with the necessary stuff. show a list of users
reviews, comments. Give user ability to remove review or comment from profile page


Jan 4 team todo:

We need api routes to delete movies, reviews and comments given the id of said item

//DELETE api/movies/id
router.delete("/:id", verify, async (req, res, next) => {})



//DELETE api/reviews/id
router.delete("/:id", verify, async (req, res, next) => {})

//DELETE api/comment/id
router.delete("/:id", verify, async (req, res, next) => {})


//Separate: Add this line to make sure only admins can do certain functions
if (!req.user.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized. Only admins can delete reviews.' });
}
